# Random Number Guessing Game (C Program)

## Description:
This is a simple C program that generates a random number between user-defined lower and upper bounds. 
The program will repeatedly ask the user to guess the number, providing feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low. 
The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.

## How to Compile and Run:

1. **If you have Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**:
   - Open the terminal in VSCode and use the following command to compile the code:
     ```bash
     gcc guess_game.c -o guess_game
     ```
   - Run the program with:
     ```bash
     ./guess_game
     ```

2. **If you don't have VSCode or prefer online tools**:
   - You can also play and run this program directly online using platforms like [replit.com](https://replit.com/)
   - or [onlinegdb.com](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler).
   - Simply paste the code into the editor, and it will compile and run the program in the browser.
